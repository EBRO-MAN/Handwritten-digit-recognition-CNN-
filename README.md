## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to demonstrate mastery of deep learning concepts, transfer learning readiness, and practical deployment using a user-friendly Gradio interface.


## Acknowledgment
We express our sincere gratitude to our course instructor Mr. Betselot Y. for providing clear instruction, and an opportunity to work on a real-world deep learning problem that strengthens our understanding of modern AI systems.


## Why We Chose This Topic
Our team selected handwritten digit recognition because:

- It provides a clean, well-established starting point for learning CNNs and transfer learning.
- The MNIST dataset is ideal for demonstrating model development, training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Most importantly, this project serves as the **foundation for our upcoming final-year project**:

        ### *Rule-Based Sheep Breeding Expert System*

        Real sheep farms rely on **ear-tag numbers** for identification. These tags often contain handwritten or printed digits. Our goal is to extend this project by:

        - Collecting sheep ear-tag images  
        - Retraining or fine-tuning this CNN model  
        - Integrating automatic tag recognition into the expert system  

        This creates a seamless pipeline where image recognition supports rule-based reasoning — a strong, innovative combination.


## Features
- CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras  
- 98–99% accuracy on MNIST dataset  
- Gradio web interface for real-time predictions  
- Clean, modular code ready for future domain-specific fine-tuning  
- Transfer-learning-friendly design


## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Gradio 


## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Loss & Accuracy Curves 


## Future Work
- Collect sheep ear-tag digit dataset  
- Apply transfer learning to adapt this model  
- Integrate into final Sheep Breeding Expert System  
- Deploy via Streamlit/Gradio as a farm-ready tool
